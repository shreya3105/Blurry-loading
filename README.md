# Blurry-loading
Project Description:
In this project, we will create an eye-catching and visually appealing loading page for a website or web application. The loading page will have a unique effect where the content behind it appears blurred and gradually comes into focus as the page loads.

Key Components and Steps:

1. *HTML Structure*: 
   - Create a basic HTML structure for the loading page, including a container for the content that needs to be loaded.

2. *CSS Styling*:
   - Apply styles to the loading page container to make it cover the entire viewport.
   - Add a background image or pattern to the loading page for added visual appeal.
   - Use CSS to create a blur effect on the background content, making it appear blurry.

3. *JavaScript Functions*:
   - Write JavaScript functions to control the loading process.
   - Use JavaScript to monitor the progress of the page loading.
   - Adjust the blur effect dynamically based on the loading progress.
   - When the page is fully loaded, remove the loading page to reveal the content underneath.

4. *Transitions and Animations*:
   - Implement smooth transitions and animations for a visually pleasing experience.
   - Gradually reduce the blur effect as the page loads to create a gradual reveal.

By following these steps and using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functions effectively, you can create a captivating blurry loading page that enhances the user experience when visiting your website or web application.
